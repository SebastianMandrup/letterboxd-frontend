# Final Project Assignment

The final project assignment is to develop a web application and deploy it to the cloud.  
It should consist of a **database**, **backend (server)**, and **frontend (client)**.

---

## Frontend
- Should be implemented as a separate application.
- Recommended: **React** library.  
- Alternatives: Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js, etc.  
- **TypeScript** is preferred and recommended (JavaScript is also acceptable).

---

## Backend
- Communicates with the frontend using **REST APIs** or **GraphQL**.
- You are free to choose any development stack:
  - TypeScript (JavaScript) / Node.js
  - Java / Spring Boot
  - C# / ASP .NET
  - Python / Django
  - PHP / Laravel
- **Note:** SQLite is not allowed because it is not a database server.

---

## Database
- Any database technology may be used, except SQLite.

---

## Example project ideas
- Car rental system  
- System for reviews of concerts and music releases  
- Banking system  
- Movie database like [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)  
- Video game database like [rawg.io](https://rawg.io/)  
- System for user reviews and recommendations of best restaurants (like yelp.com)  
- Portfolio management system for stock trading  
- Airline reservation system  
- Library management system  
- Web shop, job portal, or art collection system  

---

## Requirements
- The project should be **complex enough** to cover the curriculum of the whole course.
- Target architecture:  
  - **Database server**  
  - **Web server (backend)**  
  - **Web client (frontend)**
